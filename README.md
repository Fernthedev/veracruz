# Veracruz
_A lazily-written localization library_

# Why the name
No idea. The word just came to mind when thinking of a name, and I can't think of anything else.

API is at [shared/i18n.hpp](shared/i18n.hpp).

Include [shared/veracruz.hpp](shared/i18n.hpp) and code happily.

I'll write some docs later, am tired.

Maybe some optional headers or scripts for parsing JSON later
